# DormMate – AI and Machine Learning Enabled Smart Hostel Management System

## Project Description
DormMate is an Android-based intelligent hostel management application designed to automate and streamline hostel operations while enhancing student safety and administrative efficiency. The system integrates mobile application development, cloud services, and artificial intelligence to provide a secure, real-time, and user-friendly hostel management solution.

The application supports two primary roles: Student and Warden, with role-based access control and personalized dashboards. A key highlight of DormMate is the integration of a Python-based Machine Learning (CNN) face recognition module for secure student identity verification during hostel entry and exit.
